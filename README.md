# CT_Project

Implemented convolutional encoding and decoding techniques using both hard and soft decision decoding strategies.

Conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation by comparing theoretical and practical Bit Error Rates (BER) under varying conditions.

Analyzed the impact of different system parameters (e.g., code rate, constraint length, noise levels) on decoding accuracy.

Demonstrated understanding of digital communication concepts through simulation and analysis in MATLAB (or your specific tool, if applicable).
